This website was created to showcase [Maximal(Murdle)](https://github.com/ZanClifton/maximal-murdle), using JavaScript, React and a little CSS. The intention was to have a website all team members could use to point recruiters and potential employers towards to demonstrate our achievement. A product demonstration video is included, along with an overview, a description of the tech stack and our rationale for the choices we made with it, and individual biographies of the members of Maximal().
